# Speed Measurement Application Using Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a simple application using an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the speed of an object. The application will calculate the speed based on the time taken for the object to pass between two points, using the distance measurements provided by the ultrasonic sensor.


## Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor will emit sound waves and measure the time it takes for the 
waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By calculating the time difference 
between sending and receiving the signals, we can determine the distance of the 
object from the sensor. By continuously measuring the distance at two points, we 
can calculate the speed of the object based on the time taken to travel between 
those points.


To calculate the speed:
1. Measure the distance of the object at two distinct points.
2. Record the time taken for the object to travel between these two points.
3. Use the formula: 

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]

4. Display the speed value either on the serial monitor or an LCD.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Board
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- LCD I2C

## Software Requirements

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino according to the pin configuration.
2. (Optional) Connect the LCD display to the Arduino for speed visualization.
3. Load the provided Arduino code into the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
5. Monitor the speed values on the serial monitor or LCD.

## Arduino Code Explanation
The code is designed to:
1. Send a trigger signal to the ultrasonic sensor to emit sound waves.
2. Measure the time taken for the echo to return.
3. Calculate the distance using the time difference.
4. Determine the speed based on the distance and time between two measurements.
5. Display the calculated speed on the serial monitor or LCD.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino to measure the speed of an object. It highlights basic concepts of distance measurement and speed calculation using real-time data from the sensor.
